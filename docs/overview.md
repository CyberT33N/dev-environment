# 🚀 dev-environment

This project provides a streamlined environment for managing most needed developer services locally using docker-compose. It includes custom scripts (PowerShell for Windows, Bash for Linux) to control Docker containers and a simple configuration guide to quickly get GitLab, MongoDB, and GitLab Runner up and running.

---

# 🛠️ Key Features:
- **Local GitLab and MongoDB:** Easily spin up GitLab and MongoDB services for development and testing.
- **Service Control:** Use the `start.sh` (Linux) or `start.ps1` (Windows) script to selectively start specific services.
- **GitLab Runner Management:** Option to register a GitLab Runner for CI/CD pipelines in non-interactive or interactive mode.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on both Windows and Linux systems.

This setup is ideal for developers looking to test, build, and experiment with GitLab CI pipelines and MongoDB databases in a controlled local environment.
